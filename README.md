## The Controlled Vocabulary

This repository contains the **Edition Types Vocabulary (ETV)**, developed within the [ATLAS](https://dh-atlas.github.io/) project.

The Edition Types Vocabulary is a knowledge organization system designed to provide a structured and authoritative set of terms for describing various types of textual criticism products, particularly scholarly editions. It covers a broad spectrum of edition types—such as critical, diplomatic, genetic, and facsimile editions—offering standardized, persistent labels and curated references to support consistent classification and description of editorial practices in textual scholarship.

The vocabulary is expressed in RDF/Turtle and adheres to semantic web standards (RDF, RDFS, SKOS). It is intended to support semantic annotation and interoperability in digital humanities research.
